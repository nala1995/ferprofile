      title: 'Supply chain',
      text: 'It is not a doubt that supply chain is a notable pattern or subject when regards to globalization, whe have to look back to the covid-19 pandemic to see the importance of it, Just in lean times we can see how the supply chain works to deal with it and bring with it all the commodities wherever it has to be delivered or needed. As a professional on Foreign Trade I knew it already that is the reason why I chose  study it and work in a period of time it, but many people out there do not know that, they just pay attention for commodities thay need at an especiic moment but no more. This is an attempt to share more knowledge and information regarding. While I was working in the supply chain industry I realised that in order to improve some processes and your efficiency you have to implement some tech resources and that is not the whole on this, you have to be a wizard on it, It does not reffer just handling pivot tables or vlookup functions, you have to master on VBA excel and optimace plenty of processes in to the pathway but it does not stop there you have to learn how to show the information you are analysing and you are building from scratch or with a base made, for such purpose you have to be wizard whit Power BI this is a magnific tool where you can connect with almost every database like in SQL base or external database or Jquery that will bring and display your information in a appealing way but mainly more understandable. On the other hand you have to learn or be wizard in a same way with SAP logistics modules ERP like S/4Hana and all of its transactions managements, as well as Transformation from LE-TRA/LE-WM to TM/EWM. Let has stop here and look to the next section to see more about the future for the supply chain that is waiting for us ahead and this one is about achieving migrate the supply chain into a sustainable process while we use it. The following article is a huge investigation that the assistant professor of supply chain management at the Smeal College of Business at Penn State University, Veronica H. Villena & the Robert and Judith Auritt Klein Professor of Management at the Smeal College of Business Dennis A. Gioia for Harvard Business Review. In recent years a rising number of multinational corporations have pledged to work only with suppliers that adhere to social and environmental standards. Typically, these MNCs expect their first-tier suppliers to comply with those standards, and they ask that those suppliers in turn ask for compliance from their suppliers—who ideally ask the same from their suppliers. And so on. The aim is to create a cascade of sustainable practices that flows smoothly throughout the supply chain, or, as we prefer to call it, the supply network. It’s an admirable idea, but its been hard to realize in practice. Many of the MNCs that have committed to it have faced scandals brought about by suppliers that, despite being aware of sustainability standards, have nevertheless gone on to violate them. Consider the embarrassing scrutiny that Apple, Dell, and HP endured not long ago for sourcing electronics from overseas companies that required employees to work in hazardous conditions, and the fallout that Nike and Adidas suffered for using suppliers that were dumping toxins into rivers in China. What is more, all those scandals involved first-tier suppliers. The practices of lower-tier suppliers are almost always worse, increasing companies exposure to serious financial, social, and environmental risks. In this article we describe various ways that MNCs can defuse the ticking time bomb those risks represent. But in this area are plenty of problems, To understand the situation and develop ideas for tackling it, we conducted a study of three supply networks. Each was headed by an MNC considered to be a sustainability leader”—one in the automotive industry, one in electronics, and one in pharmaceuticals and consumer products. (For the specific selection criteria, see the “About the Research” sidebar.) We also studied a representative set of each MNC’s suppliers—a total of nine top-tier and 22 lower-tier suppliers, based variously in Mexico, China, Taiwan, and the United States. What we discovered was that many were violating the standards that the MNCs expected them to adhere to. The hoped-for cascade effect was seldom occurring. We found problems in every country we studied. In Mexico we visited five lower-tier suppliers; all lacked environmental management systems, and four lacked procedures for handling red-flag social problems such as sexual harassment, retaliation by supervisors, and hazardous labor conditions. At three of the companies, temporary workers made up nearly 50% of the workforce, and turnover rates sometimes reached 100%, making it difficult to implement viable environmental, health, and safety programs. In China and Taiwan we visited 10 lower-tier suppliers, all of which had marginal environmental practices, dangerous working conditions, and chronic overtime issues. In the United States we studied seven lower-tier suppliers and found that three had high concentrations of airborne chemicals and a lack of systematic accident reporting. The pattern is worrisome. Remember, all those suppliers were connected to model firms that were working proactively to encourage sustainability. If exemplary MNCs are having trouble ensuring good practices among their lower-tier suppliers, then “regular” firms, in all likelihood, are faring even worse at this. The problem, ironically, often starts with the MNCs themselves. They frequently place orders that exceed suppliers’ capacity or impose unrealistic deadlines, leading supplier factories to demand heavy overtime from their workers. When we asked a representative at one supplier why his company had violated a 60-hour workweek limit, he gave us a frank explanation: “We didn’t want to tell our customer that we can’t produce its products on time, because otherwise it’s going to try to find someone else that can. But our customer did not give us enough notice to hire enough skilled people to do the job. First-tier suppliers, for their part, rarely concern themselves with their own suppliers sustainability practices. Furthermore, most lower-tier suppliers are not well known, so they receive relatively little attention and pressure from the media, NGOs, and other stakeholders. Even when they do attract attention (for sexual harassment problems, for example, or chronic overtime demands), we found that they do not feel the need to address the issues involved. They tend to act only when MNCs intervene. Lower-tier suppliers are also the least equipped to handle sustainability requirements. They often do not have sustainability expertise or resources, and they may be unaware of accepted social and environmental practices and regulations. They are also frequently located in countries where such regulations are nonexistent, lax, or not enforced at all. And typically they don’t know much about the sustainability requirements imposed by MNCs—but even if they do, they have no incentive to comply. This may explain why most of the lower-tier suppliers in our study lacked programs to dispose of toxic waste and in fact had no environmental management program whatsoever. In conclusion Many multinational corporations sincerely want to embed fair labor practices and environmental responsibility throughout their supply networks. A good way to start is by adopting the sustainability strategies used by the three MNCs in our study. But all corporations can and should do more. They should send their suppliers a more consistent message that economic, social, and environmental requirements are all important. They should make the same message clear to their procurement officials and create incentives for them to pursue not only economic goals but also environmental and social goals. Those officials should take a hands-on approach to collecting data about suppliers capacity, monitoring indicators of their sustainability performance, and engaging with them in continuous improvement projects.',

      text: 'This branch of economics and administration in the logistics and mutual benefit treaties for different societies is marvelous. Furthermore it is full of responsibilities and if you see the pathway you have to take to become professional on this, you will see that you have to learn plenty of regulations and affairs about customs laws legislation laws and comercial laws too but it does not halt there you have to learn how to implement all of them in differents countries and National customs territory whe the laws change all the time, furthermore you have to learn how to implement all of those mixed with the learning of International physical distribution and beyond of negotiations patterns with international customers making a right use of international terms known as INCOTERMS which were undated in 2022 and periodically will carry on changing ahead. What is expecting for us ahead on this field is beign aware of the environment and climate change that is a reality and for that we have to become more sustainable in different ways and build new processes in order to work with it or modifie it to make it work toguether. The acceleration of climate change has underscored the urgent need for sustainable practices in international business. The carbon footprint associated with transportation, manufacturing, and resource extraction in global supply chains has far-reaching consequences. By adopting eco-friendly technologies, promoting renewable energy sources, and embracing circular economies, businesses can contribute to mitigating climate change and preserving the environment. With heightened awareness and increased consumer activism, businesses are under scrutiny for their social responsibility and ethical practices. Consumers are increasingly making choices based on a companys commitment to fair labor practices human rights and community welfare. By prioritizing sustainability businesses can build trust with consumers enhance brand reputation, and contribute positively to the societies in which they operate. The regulatory landscape for international business is evolving rapidly, with many countries imposing stricter environmental and social standards. Adhering to these regulations is not only a legal obligation but also a strategic imperative. Non-compliance can lead to reputational damage, legal issues, and financial losses. Therefore, integrating sustainability into business operations is a proactive approach to manage regulatory risks and ensure long-term viability. Sustainable practices often translate into resource efficiency and cost savings. Adopting green technologies, optimizing supply chain processes, and minimizing waste not only contribute to environmental conservation but also result in economic benefits. Businesses that prioritize sustainability can achieve long-term cost competitiveness and operational resilience. Addressing global challenges requires collaborative efforts. Businesses engaged in foreign trade can leverage partnerships with governments, NGOs, and other enterprises to amplify the impact of their sustainability initiatives. Collaborative approaches enable the sharing of best practices, technology transfer, and the development of innovative solutions to address shared sustainability goals. As we navigate the complex web of global commerce in 2023 and beyond, the importance of sustainability in foreign trade and international business cannot be overstated. Beyond being a moral imperative, sustainability has become a strategic necessity for businesses seeking to thrive in a world facing environmental, social, and economic challenges. Embracing sustainability is not merely a trend but a fundamental shift in the way we conduct international business, offering a pathway to a more resilient, responsible, and prosperous global economy.',

If is taken in count the Automation and Robotics in Warehousing, The integration of automation and robotics in warehouses is set to redefine the efficiency and accuracy of inventory management. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs), robotic arms, and autonomous drones can streamline tasks such as picking, packing, and sorting, reducing human error, and accelerating the order fulfillment process. This not only enhances operational speed but also contributes to cost savings and a more sustainable supply chain. On the other hand we have IoT and Real-Time tracking, The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to revolutionize how warehouses and customs processes are managed. Real-time tracking of goods through connected sensors and devices allows for precise monitoring of inventory levels, shipment locations, and environmental conditions. This not only facilitates better decision-making but also enables stakeholders to address issues such as delays, theft, or damage promptly. Another insight we can find is Data Analytics for Predictive Insights, Leveraging big data analytics can provide warehouses and customs authorities with valuable insights into trends, demand patterns, and potential bottlenecks. Predictive analytics can optimize inventory levels, allowing for better resource allocation and reducing the risk of stockouts or overstock situations. Customs agencies can also benefit from data analytics to enhance risk assessment and improve the accuracy of inspections. We should take in count another solutions like implementing Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency, Implementing blockchain technology in warehouse and customs operations offers a transparent and secure way to record and verify transactions. This ensures the authenticity of information related to the origin, shipping, and handling of goods. The decentralized nature of blockchain minimizes the risk of fraud, enhances traceability, and fosters trust among all stakeholders involved in the supply chain. We might suggest Customs Modernization and Paperless Processes, Governments and customs agencies can facilitate smoother international trade by embracing digital transformation. Moving towards paperless processes, electronic documentation, and e-customs platforms can significantly reduce the administrative burden on businesses. This shift not only expedites clearance processes but also minimizes the environmental impact associated with paper usage.',
